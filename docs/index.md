## Introduction

This project aims to exactly describe the behavior of ZZT creatures by disassembling
ZZT.EXE.  To that end, the following artifacts have been produced:

* [Pseudocode for ZZT functions][creature_behaviors] informed by:
* [Annotated disassembly of ZZT procedures][Disassembly] generated by:
* [An IDA Pro database of ZZT.EXE][Database]

[Disassembly]: https://github.com/cknave/zztasm/tree/master/asm
[Database]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cknave/zztasm/master/ida/zzt.idc


## Organization

The analysis of the disassembly is split into three sections:

* [Structures][structures] define the memory layout of notable parts of ZZT
* [Support functions][support_functions] used by creatures are provided in pseudocode
* [Creature behaviors][creature_behaviors] are also provided in pseudocode
